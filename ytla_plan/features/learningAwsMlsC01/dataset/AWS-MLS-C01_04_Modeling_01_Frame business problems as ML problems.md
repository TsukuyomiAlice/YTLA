## Modeling
### Frame business problems as machine learning problems. 
#### When to use/when not to use ML
    * Effective goal is to take the predictions (aka inference) to generalize well against new inputs
    * Good use for problems if: 
      * either too complex for traditional programming approach have no known algorithm
      * a fluctuating env, where ml can adapt to the new data
      * getting insights/patterns about complex problems and large amounts of data (data mining)
    * Don't use otherwise possibly in favor of a traditional programming approach

#### Know the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning


#### Selecting from among classification, regression, forecasting, clustering, recommendation, etc.
