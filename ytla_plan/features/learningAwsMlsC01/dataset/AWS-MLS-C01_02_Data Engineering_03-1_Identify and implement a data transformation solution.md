  * Handle ML-specific data using map reduce (Hadoop, Spark, Hive) 
  * Transforming data transit (ETL: Glue, EMR, AWS Batch)

#### AWS Step Functions:
  * A visual workflow service that helps developers use AWS services with λ to build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate micro services, or create data (ML) pipelines
  * JSON used to declare state machines under the hood
  * Advanced Error Handling and retry mechanism outside the code
  * Audit history of workflows is available
  * Able to "wait" for any length of time, though the max execustion time of a state machine is 1 year
  * Great for orchestrating and tracking and ordered flow of resources
